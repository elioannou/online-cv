career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
    
      I have recently submitted my PhD thesis and I am continuing as a
      researcher at the Laboratory for Scientific Computing, University of
      Cambridge. My work involves the development of mathematical models of
      physical systems and the implementation of computational algorithms to
      solve them numerically.

education:
    - degree: PhD in Physics
      university: University of Cambridge
      time: 2014 - 2018
      details: |
        My research is on the numerical simulation of high speed flow in multi-material configurations that include reactive and solid (elastic-plastic) materials.

          - Supervised by Dr Nikolaos Nikiforakis at the Laboratory for Scientific Computing in the Physics Department.

    - degree: MSc in Scientific Computing
      university: University of Cambridge
      time: 2013 - 2014
      details: |
        The course was half taught (mostly on numerical methods and programming) and half research.

          - Graduated with Distinction.
          - Thesis title: “Shock induced collapse of binary systems of cavities”.
          - Supervised by Dr Nikolaos Nikiforakis.

    - degree: BSc in Physics
      university: National and Kapodistrian University of Athens
      time: 2007 - 2012
      details: |

          - Grade: 8.25/10 (Ranked 3rd).
          - Specialization field: Astrophysics, Astronomy and Mechanics.
          - My thesis title is “Relaxation processes in the Galactic nuclei” and I was supervised by Professor Theocharis Apostolatos.

experiences:
    - role: Demonstrator at practical classes
      time: 2014 -2017
      company: University of Cambridge
      details: |
        Supervision and guidance of students performing whole-day experiments and marking their work.

    - role: Research Assistant
      time: Mar -  Jun 2013
      company: Cyprus University of Technology
      details: |
        I worked on a research project on the subject of super accelerated free-fall under the supervision of Professor Evangelos Akylas.
